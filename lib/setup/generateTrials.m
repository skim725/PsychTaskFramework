function [ trialTbl ] = generateTrials(levelConfig)
% GENERATETRIALS Generates a table of risk&ambiguity trials that contain all
%   combinations of `levelConfig` struct subfields.
%
% NOTE: The generator is specific to the risk/ambiguity task. It expects that %
% the struct will contain `stakes` and at least one of (`probs`, `ambigs`)
% fields.  % It will also combine them in a particular way (specifically,
% assuming that all ambiguous % trials are coupled with .5 probability, and all
% probability trials have at % least one appearance with zero ambiguity). It
% distributes all other subfields % it finds randomly across thus generated
% trials.
%
% If you wish to omit any ambiguous trials but do not wish to delete the struct
% field, you can also pass an empty matrix to achieve the same result.
%
% Generally speaking: if your task only differs slightly from the monetary R&A
% task, you should be able to use this script with minimum alteration. If your
% task is substantially different, you might have to roll your own.

[stakes_P, trialProbs] = ndgrid(allStakes, allProbs, 1:trialRepeats);
[stakes_A, trialAmbigs] = ndgrid(allStakes, allAmbigs, 1:trialRepeats);
% NOTE: The reason this works is that while `ndgrid` creates an n-dimensional
%   matrix for each argument that has size > 1, all the values are extracted
%   with `var(:)`, rendering dimensionality moot. (It works with empty
%   matrices.)
